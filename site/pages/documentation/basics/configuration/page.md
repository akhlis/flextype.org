Flextype allows you to configure your site in any way you can dream up, and itâ€™s thanks to the powerful and flexible configuration options that make this possible. Configuration files are written in YAML syntax with a .yaml file extension. YAML is a data serialisation language designed to be directly writable and readable by humans. You can check out this [YAML help page](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) to get a complete understanding of the syntax available.

## Site configuration

You can update and create site configuration by editing file `/site/config/site.yaml`

```
