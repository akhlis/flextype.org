Make sure your server meets the following requirements.       
* Webserver (Apache with [Mod Rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html))  
* PHP 7.1.3 or higher with PHP's [Multibyte String module](http://php.net/mbstring)

For better performance we recommend to use caching: APC, APCu, XCache, Memcached, or Redis.
