You can start editing the content and customising your site.

### Edit this Page

### Create a New page
Creating a new page is very simple in Rawilum.  

1. Launch your text editor and paste this sample text:

    ```
    ---
    title: My New Page
    ---
    # My New Page!

    This is the body of **My New Page**
    ```

2. Save this file in the `/site/pages/my-new-page/` folder as `index.md` and its will be available by this url: {site_url}/my-new-page

That is it!
